Almost done! 

this one looks like the 'Cloud City' hero page I designed on day 24. I basically modified that template, which was modified from  w3schools tutorial.
I added some fade in animations to this one, but thought of it toward the end of the time limit, so did not get a chance to dial it in properly. The copy does not really go well with the site, but I wanted to take some creative license and see how much better I can get within the hour time limit.
