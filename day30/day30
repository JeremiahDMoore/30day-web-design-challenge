Well, this is the last entry of the Challenge! I kept it simple with a focus on design that is eye catching, but not abraisive. A gradient background, animation, and simple typefaces with a fade-in. Here we have a very simple page with a call to action button that is elegant and asks the user to get started setting up a profile for engagement, and conversion.

This challenge has shown me my strengths and weaknesses as a web designer. Typefaces and fonts are something that I have struggled with before, and I see major improvement there. Also, busting outside the box, and using simplicity to not overwhelm the user. Early examples may have been visually ugly because of this. Button styling should be simple and sometimes not even necessary, same with nav menus. The time constraint of 1 hour has been helful to just go without thinking and let the design of the page evolve. Many times I pick background graphics that go unused or changed to something else. 

Thank you for checking out this challenge it was very fun! By sticking with this for 30 days in a row I have learned the most important thing: I love doing this and can easily do it every day!
