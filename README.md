30 day Web Design Challenge inspired by Flux

The challenge involves building a hero section of a web page from scratch every day for 30 days using HTML and CSS,
using random ideas from https://ideasai.net/ . The text on each page is copied directly from the randomized startup idea generated from the site.

I followed a strict 1 hour time limit to design everything: finding font pairs, naming the site, etc. After the 1 hour is up, all work on the hero page is stopped.
For this reason, I chose not to focus on making the page responsive to fit multiple screen sizes. Pages should be viewed in standard 16:9 format.

All testing was done in Chrome browser on Windows 10 PCs. I tried to incorporate different things in each web page such as animations, call to action buttons, animated text, etc. so the sites did not all look the same.
